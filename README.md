# Light-Souls
### A 2D Roguelite Boss Rush

A difficult fast-paced 'Dark-Souls' inspired game where the player has to fight through challenging enemies. The game is challenging enough for persistent players to return to obtain and finish the game. As the game progresses the player will be able to upgrade their character and obtain different abilities using the skill tree to change up their style of gameplay. Everything is subject to change as we are not dead set on the game yet.

A world in which the souls of people are taken and you as the player are trying to journey into the depths to find your soul.
You are a criminal who as punishment had their soul taken and they decided to reclaim it, but the journey is harsh and is guarded by many creatures which will make getting the soul difficult.

There is an end gate per level, you have to fight your way through areas to find keys to open doors where each key is guarded by a small mini boss and the final door has one larger boss to fight. The player can go to the shop to make upgrades to prepare for the next levels.
The player traverses through different levels in increasing difficulty fighting enemies. Their end goal is to reclaim their soul.
